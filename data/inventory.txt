Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines 
principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze 
large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what 
will happen, and what can be done with the results.
Why is data science important?
Data science is important because it combines tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data. Modern organizations 
are inundated with data; there is a proliferation of devices that can automatically collect and store information. Online systems 
and payment portals capture more data in the fields of e-commerce, medicine, finance, and every other aspect of human life. We have
text, audio, video, and image data available in vast quantities.  

History of data science
While the term data science is not new, the meanings and connotations have changed over time. The word first appeared in the ’60s 
as an alternative name for statistics. In the late ’90s, computer science professionals formalized the term. A proposed definition 
for data science saw it as a separate field with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis. It still took another decade 
for the term to be used outside of academia.
