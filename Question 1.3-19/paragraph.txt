Data science is a discipline that combines math, statistics, artificial intelligence and computer science to process large volumes 
of data and determine patterns and trends. With these insights, organizations can better understand why certain events happen and 
develop more informed decision-making processes. Data science is the realm of data scientists, who often rely on artificial 
intelligence, especially its subfields of machine learning and deep learning, to create models and make predictions using algorithms
and other techniques.
